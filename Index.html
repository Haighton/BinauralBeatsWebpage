        <h2>Theory Behind Binaural Beats</h2>
        <p>Binaural beats are an auditory illusion created when two slightly different frequencies are played separately into each ear. The brain perceives a third tone that is the mathematical difference between the two frequencies. This phenomenon is known as binaural beats, and it can influence brainwave activity, potentially inducing various mental states.</p>
        <p>Binaural beats were first discovered in 1839 by German scientist Heinrich Wilhelm Dove. He found that when two tones of slightly different frequencies are played into each ear, the brain perceives a pulsating sound, the beat, which is not actually present in the audio. This discovery led to further exploration into how these beats interact with brainwave activity.</p>
        <p>In more recent times, scientists have explored the effects of binaural beats on brain activity using EEG (electroencephalography) technology. Researchers have found that binaural beats may influence brainwave frequencies, encouraging the brain to enter different states, such as relaxation, focus, or even deep meditation. Studies are still ongoing, but binaural beats are often used in therapeutic contexts to help with anxiety, stress reduction, and even sleep improvement.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, binaural beats are widely used in the field of meditation and mindfulness. When a person listens to binaural beats, the brain's electrical activity is thought to synchronize with the frequency of the perceived beat. This synchronization can be used to guide the brain into specific mental states. This is also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainwave_entrainment" target="_blank">brainwave entrainment</a>. The main brainwave categories are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span><strong>Delta Waves (0.5 - 4 Hz)</strong>: Deep sleep and healing.</span></li>
            <li><span><strong>Theta Waves (4 - 8 Hz)</strong>: Deep relaxation and meditation.</span></li>
            <li><span><strong>Alpha Waves (8 - 12 Hz)</strong>: Light relaxation and creativity.</span></li>
            <li><span><strong>Beta Waves (12 - 30 Hz)</strong>: Alertness and concentration.</span></li>
            <li><span><strong>Gamma Waves (30 - 100 Hz)</strong>: Heightened perception and problem-solving.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because of these potential effects, many people use binaural beats as part of their meditation routine. The soothing and rhythmic nature of the beats, combined with their ability to help the brain enter a calm state, makes them a popular tool for achieving deeper meditative states or simply promoting relaxation.</p>

        <h2>How to Use the Tool</h2>
        <p>This tool generates binaural beats for meditation, relaxation, and brainwave entrainment. Here's how to use the tool:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Select a Base Frequency</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li><span>You can choose a base frequency using the piano keyboard or from preset buttons.</span></li>
                    <li><span>The base frequency determines the pitch of the sound in one ear.</span></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Adjust the Beat Frequency</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Use the input box to set the difference in frequency between the two audio channels, which creates the binaural beat.</span></li>
                    <li><span>The beat frequency corresponds to different brainwave states (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma), which can influence mental states such as relaxation, focus, or creativity.</span></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Brainwave Entrainment</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li><span>For a more guided experience, you can enable brainwave entrainment. This feature allows you to move through different brainwave frequencies over a set period of time, helping you achieve specific mental states such as deep meditation or alertness.</span></li>
                    <li><span>You can manually configure the entrainment process by setting the frequencies and the time intervals between them.</span></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Add Background Sounds</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li><span>You have the option to play soothing background noise alongside the binaural beats.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Search for field recordings or ambient sounds from <a href="https://freesound.org/">Freesound.org</a> to complement your experience.</span></li>
                    <li><span>You can choose nature sounds, urban environments, or other ambient noise to enhance your meditation session.</span></li>
                    <li><span>You can also use some of my own Binaural Field Recordings on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/deteq/sets/field-recordings?si=d64b7bcdab9c4f0e87c25f253c48c84f&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a>.</span></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Playback Controls</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Use the Play/Stop buttons to start or stop the audio.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Adjust the volume to a comfortable level using the volume slider.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Combine the binaural beats with background noise for a richer sound experience.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Each has their own volume and playback controls for optimal control of the experience.</span></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
